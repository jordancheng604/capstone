                The original intent of this is to help share and spread information about Aviation Helicopters and saying Thank-You to those that serve and have served.

                Thank you for the sacrifices that you and your family have made. 

                We believe that there is not enough appreication for those that serve and have served; and therefore, encourage people to look into voltuneering or donations. If you're thinking about helping out somewhere, please consider our veterans.

                This project started with Canadian Military Helicopters, and will continue to slowly grow and add more Military Aircraft and Equipment to the website.

                We are a small team, so please me patient with us if you do not see the aircraft you are looking for.

                Our goal is to eventually have all NATO military equipment listed on our website.

                There have been unforseen difficulties in collecting appropriate information and content to not break any copyright laws.

                If you would like to see your favorite Aircraft listed on our website. Feel free to use the Contact page and let us know. And if you have a favorite picture, that you own, and would like have it on our website please kindly send it to us via email.
